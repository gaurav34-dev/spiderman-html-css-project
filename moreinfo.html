			<h2>Secret Identity : Peter Parker</h2>
				<img src="peter parker.jpeg" alt="Peter Parker" id="image" height=400px width=300px/>
				<p>Spiderman's secret identity is <b>Peter Parker</b>, an orphan raised by his Aunt May and Uncle Ben in New York City after his parents Richard and Mary Parker died in a plane crash.
				<br><br>His origin story has him acquiring spider-related abilities after a bite from a radioactive spider; these include clinging to surfaces, superhuman strength and agility, and detecting danger with his "spider-sense." He then builds wrist-mounted "web-shooter" devices that shoot artificial spider-webbing of his own design. 
				<b>PETER PARKER</b> and <b>SPIDER MAN</b>,
				were split into separate beings due to an accident involving the reverse-engineered Isotope Genome Accelerator. However, the separation split Peter down the middle, so both individuals did not share Peter's sense of responsibility, resulting in a reckless and vain Spider-Man..
				<br><br>He resides on the outskirts of <b><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_City" target="_blank">New York City</a></b> 
				The Spider-Man series broke ground by featuring Peter Parker, a high school student from Queens behind Spider-Man's secret identity and with whose "self-obsessions with rejection, inadequacy, and loneliness" young readers could relate.[9] While Spider-Man had all the makings of a sidekick, unlike previous teen heroes such as Bucky and Robin, Spider-Man had no superhero mentor like Captain America and Batman; he thus had to learn for himself that "with great power there must also come great responsibility"â€”a line included in a text box in the final panel of the first Spider-Man story but later retroactively attributed to his guardian, the late Uncle Ben Parker.</p>
